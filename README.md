# Logic-Calculator 
## About The Project ðŸ“š

This project was proposed by the teacher of Computational Mathematics course at University of Fortaleza (UNIFOR)
We've been requested to develop a propositional logic calculator, using the logical connectives and verifying for a WFF (well-formulated-formula), printing the results
in the form of truth table.<br>
Development in collaboration with [Rafael Saboia](https://github.com/rafaelsaboia)

## Usage
Simply type in a WFF in the input box, using the logical operators as described:

ConjunÃ§Ã£o: ^
Condicional: >
DisjunÃ§Ã£o: v
Bicondicional: â†”

| Logical Operation  | Operator |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Conjunction  |  ^  |
| Disjunction  | v  |
| Conditional  | >  |
| Biconditional  | â†”  |

## Roadmap

- [x] Add Layout
- [x] Add buttons
- [x] Add explanation
- [x] Add "about" page
- [x] Verify WFF
- [ ] Calculate logical value
- [ ] Build table on result
